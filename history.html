    <span class="yoshimi">Yoshimi</span> is not
    <a href="http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/">
      <span class="zyn">ZynAddSubFX</span>
    </a>,
    but we have not forgotten from whence we hath come, and we salute thee!
  </p>

  <p>
    ZynAddSubFX was founded by <a href="http://www.paulnasca.com/">
      <span class="person">Paul Nasca</span></a> and continued by many
    others. Several years later, Yoshimi was founded by our dear friend,
    the late <span class="person">Alan Calvert (Cal)</span>, at a time when
    ZynAddSubFX showed amazing promise, but did not satisfy his needs and ours.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="person">Jeremy Jongepier</span> was instrumental in
    obtaining access to the SourceForge repository after we lost Cal,
    and maintained it until early 2014, accepting small improvements
    from a number of people. Then, with a young family and other interests,
    he felt he could no longer do so. At that time, I had become well known
    as a Yoshimi instrument designer and a sort-of general bug finder,
    and, with considerable prompting from others, agreed to take over as
    a caretaker. I had limited C coding experience, no C++ knowledge,
    and never been involved in version control.
  </p>

  <p>
    The early work was mainly minor corrections and improvements.
    Many people gave support, in particular <span class="person">Rob Couto</span>,
    who has been a mentor and contributor throughout this time.
    <span class="person">Harry Nakos</span> helped me with the first GUI change
    - enabling a single row mixer panel. Later, <span class="person">Andrew
      Deryabin</span> coded the LV2 and multi-instance extensions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile, <span class="person">Harry</span> supplied the preliminary
    example code that was to become the basis of the much improved instrument
    bank structure. <span class="person">Andrew</span> then ran with this and
    coded the full structure, which over time has been developed further.
    Andrew also continued to provide help from time to time.
  </p>

  <p>
    By early 2015, I had gained enough experience to implement vector control,
    and later most of the NRPN code. The end of that year saw the first
    development of CLI (command line) access, aimed at making Yoshimi
    accessible to blind and disabled musicians. Since that time,
    <span class="person">Jeanette C.</span> has frequently given her
    invaluable advice as a blind user, as well as a segment of code to
    implement proper readline features.
  </p>

  <p>
    The channel switching feature (Solo) was implemented in the middle of 2016,
    and crossfade control arrived later in the year. A major feature, MIDI‑learn,
    was added at the end of that year.
  </p>
  <p>
    Towards the end of 2016 <span class="person">Jörn Eichler</span> identified a
    problem with filter tracking whereby it was impossible to track pitch 100% -
    then produced the code to do so. Later he added the first improved tooltips
    that gave real values on some controls.
  </p>
  <p>
    Throughout 2017, <span class="person">Jesper Lloyd</span> provided additional
    enhanced tooltips, along with a number of other GUI improvements and bug fixes.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the beginning of 2018, <span class="person">Kristian Amlie</span> devised
    interpolation for Yoshimi’s effects to enable smooth transition when changing
    controls in real time.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the end of that year, <span class="person">Hermann Voßeler</span> did
    considerable work improving and tidying up the random number generator, and
    correcting some mistakes I had made, so it is now thread-safe and
    future-proof. He continues to provide assistance.
  </p>

  <p>
    In early 2019, it became possible to <em>compile</em> a <em>headless version</em>
    of Yoshimi, and in the middle of the year, <span class="person">Kristian</span>
    implemented a major improvement to the AddSynth modulators - officially released
    with Yoshimi version 1.6.0. The copy/paste storage was also greatly improved,
    as it implemented a pattern similar to that of banks.
    <span class="person">Hermann</span> also did considerable work refactoring
    code, making it more readable and easier to maintain, especially regarding the
    command interface.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the late summer of 2019 an instrument search feature was added.
    The new feature made it possible to find and load instruments from across
    all available banks, through lists of instruments with the same type.
  </p>
  <p>
    The minor version release 1.6.1, in December of 2019 brought corrections to the notes
    and allocation terminology of the microtonal scales, additional improvements to the CLI,
    improved configuration management, and also some performance improvements in the GUI.
  </p>
  <p>
    The 1.7.0 release, in January 2020, featured the efforts of <span class="person">Kristian</span>
    to provide live feedback to almost every parameter in the synth engines! It also included a number
    of bug fixes.
  </p>
  <p>
    In April 2020, 1.7.1 was released, with Pan Law settings, experimental support for aftertouch input,
    a new waveform shape (hyperbolic secant) and a powerful new way of controlling Solo mode by using
    channel controls.

    In addition, the handling of banks was made more consistent with normal standards, making them easier
    to use and more predictable when controlled with bank select signals.
    The release also featured a large number of code improvements from various
    contributors. Most prominently <span class="person">Iain King-Speir</span> who both cleaned
    up a lot of code and provided fixes and improvements to the legato implementation.
  </p>
  <p>
    August 17th of 2020 saw the release of 1.7.2. The most important change was the addition of width and center
    controls for random panning, allowing greater control of the panning range. Additionally, the FM modulation algorithm was improved (by <span class="person">Kristian Amlie</span>, who also provided some additional fixes and optimizations), instrument file compatibility issues were addressed, numerous gui bugs were fixed and some new dynamic tooltips were added.
  </p>
  <p>
    The major release of 2.0.0 was made in early 2021 and a saw number of major improvements, with the most notable one being the ability to resize all windows - allowing a much better experience on larger, and high-dpi monitors. Other improvements included LFO Sync, improved LV2 performance and general performance improvements on some RISC-architecture CPUs, extra instrument types (with instrument bank revisions to include said types).
  </p>
  <p>
    The 2.0.0 release also saw improvements to the instrument bank and instrument type systems, and MIDI-learn.
    It added persistent aftertouch and pan law settings (the latter also being a new feature).
    A new file browser was implemented, replacing the stock fltk browser to provide more control and some quality-of-life features.
  </p>
  <p>And the story continues...</p>
