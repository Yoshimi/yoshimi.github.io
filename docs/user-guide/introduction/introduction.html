    This guide is intended for general day-to-day use, giving the most important information so that you can get the most out of Yoshimi. There is also a highly detailed <b>Advanced Reference Manual</b> in Portable Document format, complete with references for those wanting an in-depth understanding. This can be found on-line <a href="https://github.com/Yoshimi/yoshimi-doc/raw/master/pdf/yoshimi-advanced-reference-manual.pdf">Here</a>. You might also like to take a look at Yoshimi's own <a href="http://yoshimi.github.io">Website</a>.

    <p>
    Yoshimi is a fully polyphonic, multi-timbral, multi-channel software synthesiser.
    </p>
    <p>
    Sound is built up from combinations of three quite different synthesis <b>Engines</b> which, apart from using different methods to create a basic waveform, independently have control of amplitude, panning, filters, and frequency adjustments.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can have a <b>Kit</b> of up to 16 of these triple engine synthesisers with various overlapping key ranges. These enable you to create complex multi-layered sounds or small drum kits.
    </p>
    <p>
    This complete <b>Instrument</b> patch is then optionally passed through up to three effects such as <b>Reverb</b>, <b>Phaser</b> and <b>Equalisation</b>. From here output from this <b>Part</b> is given a number and assigned to an individual MIDI input channel, overall key range, Continuous Controller (CC) sensitivities and degree of polyphony.
    </p>
    <p>
    Parts, can have further <b>Insertion</b> effects applied to them before being directed to either the main audio output, an individual output (if such is available), or both! The main output can have <b>System</b> effects combined from all active parts.
    </p>
    <p>
    Yoshimi is a highly complex synth with very extensive control options. Therefore, it is split up into a number of context sensitive windows to make this manageable. All of these windows are resizable, and the size and position are stored. With the exception of the Console window, they also maintain their geometry and the contents are scaled accordingly.
    <br><br>
    You will probably only use a fraction of the options available, but the more obscure ones are there for the occasions when you <b><em>do</em></b> need them.
    <br><br>
    <b>If in doubt, experiment!</b>
