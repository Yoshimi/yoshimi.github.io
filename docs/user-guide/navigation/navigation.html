    <p>
    Navigation through Yoshimi is done with a combination of windows, menus and buttons. If in doubt simply hover the mouse pointer over these and usually a tooltip will appear with additional information. In some cases you will get additional information just hovering over certain parts of windows.
    <br><br>
    All windows are resizable up to the screen size, and their positions and sizes will be remembered between sessions. With the exception of the Console window, they will also remain in scale, including all their contents.
    <br><br>
    The two views below show just how accurate the rescale is. This was on a 1920 x 1080 pixel display. We've reduced the images to save space, hence the slight blurring.
    </p>

    <img src="images/gui_big.png" alt="expanded view" class="double">
    <p>
    The Console window needs to be be resizable independently horizontally and vertically because you may want to see longer lines, or alternatively you may just want to see more lines. With this in mind, the text size will <b>not</b> scale with the dimensions. Instead there is an entry in <a href="../config/config.html">Settings</a> for this. It will be saved and restored over new sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
    All rotary controllers respond to mouse pointer drags that are an average of the vertical and horizontal movement, so you can drag from left to right, bottom to top, or even bottom left to top right.
    </p>
    <p>
    Using the left hand button gives quite coarse control. With the middle button the control is finer and the scroll wheel also gives quite fine control without having to move the mouse itself. For all of these, if you hold down the <em>Ctrl</em> key at the same time, you will get much finer control.
    <br><br>
    The right hand button is an exception as a click on this will immediately set the control to its default value, and using the <em>Ctrl</em> key here will initiate a <a href="../mlearn/mlearn.html">MIDI learn</a> event.
    </p>
    <p>
    Sliders behave in a similar way, although there is no difference between the left hand button and the middle one. Again, most of these can be learned.
    <br><br>
    Almost all of the above controls have dynamic tooltips showing you what the current setting is. Also the default settings have been very carefully thought out - especially the ones deep in the synth <i>engines</i> so just enabling features can produce dramatic results.
    </p>
    <p>
    Any check/tick box with a pale blue surround can be learned. These will be <em>On</em> if the incoming value is greater than 63, otherwise <em>Off</em>. The counters and spinboxes with pale blue surrounds to the arrows can also be learned and will give a scaled response to the incoming value.
    </p>
    <p>
    Blue arrowed menus are a bit strange, as you have to first click on them to open up the menu, then click the right hand button while holding <em>Ctrl</em>. The incoming value will again be scaled to the numeric menu range.
    </p>
    <p>
    The final learnable type is any button with a blue surround - not the button itself (the exception being the Mono/Stereo button). Some of these will take immediate effect while others are only next note.
    </p>
    <p>
    In many places you will see a pair of small dark blue buttons marked '<b>C</b>' and '<b>P</b>'. These enable you to copy the entire contents of just that section and later paste it to either a <a href="../preset/preset.html">Presets</a> file or to another identical section. For example you can copy AddSynth Global in part 1 and then paste it to any other AddSynth Global engine, such as part 4 kit item number 7 AddSynth.
    </p>
    <p>
    With all windows, the title bar has the Yoshimi name usually followed by the instance number if it's not the main one. Most of the windows also have additional information, such as what section/context they represent and from part level upwards you will see the current part number, instrument name and if it is a kit element the kit item number.

    <p>
    Yoshimi uses its own file manager, maintaining style consistency with everything else. The two views here are that of loading an Instrument patch, and the variation for setting and using 'Favourites'. The top text line on both of these views is a reminder as to exactly which file type you are dealing with.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the example's first view, directories are at the top of the list with an appropriate icon. A double click on these will select that directory placing it in the <b>Path</b> field and rebuilding the list. You can also manually edit the path field to go to a known route, and on hitting 'Return' the list will be updated.
      <br>
      When <em>saving</em> files, you can add new directories here. You will get a popup request for confirmation, and then can save the file in the newly created one. This is also true when <em>exporting</em> banks, PadSynth sample sets, etc.
      <br><br>
      The <b>Up</b> button takes you back along the directory tree, or you can simply edit out one or more directory names and hit 'Return'.
      <br><br>
      After these are the files. Only files with a valid extension are shown - Yoshimi would in any case reject any others. A single click on these will place them in the <b>Name</b> field but will not actually load them, so you can edit this and then click on the <b>Load</b> button. Alternatively a double click will immediately perform the full action.
     <br><br>
      Clicking on the <b>Add</b> button will copy whatever is in the path field to the favourites list, and take you to that view. This can also be reached by clicking on the <b>Show List</b> button.
      <br><br>
    <b>Note</b>
    <br>
    &emsp;The <em>Path</em> and <em>Name</em> fields along with the <em>Up</em> and <em>Load</em> buttons will change depending on what type of file is being managed. See below.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the favourites view, the currently selected path is highlighted in blue, and this one can be made the default. It will then be placed at the top of the list. Currently the maximum number of favourites is 20 - although most people only seem to set five or six.
      <br><br>
      Selecting one of these doesn't actually set the <em>path</em> field as you may be simply wanting to organise the list. Clicking on the <b>Set</b> button will do so and return you to the main filer view. Also, a <em>double</em> click on one of the items will set the path and return you to the main view.
      <br><br>
      Clicking on the <em>Set</em> button will always set the highlighted entry, so entering the view then immediately doing this is a quick way to set the default. Alternatively a double click on any entry will select <em>and</em> set it, returning you to the normal view.
      <br><br>
    <b>Note</b>
    <br>
    &emsp;Each time Yoshimi is started, loading and saving external <em>instruments</em> will always offer the default location (as set here). At other times and with all other file types the most recently seen will be offered (unless the recently seen list is empty).

    <b>Note</b>
    <br>
    &emsp;Neither 'Path to Bank Root dirs' nor 'Bank to Import' have a name field. This is because you are directly importing or registering a path containing these elements, not the elements themselves. Therefore the path 'leaf' <em>is</em> the name. However, when <em>exporting</em> a bank, you will want to give it a name.
