    New users will have all the default ones that were available at the time they <b>first</b> run Yoshimi. These will all be copied to <b><em>.local/share/found</em></b>.
    <br><br>
    For existing users, these are not automatically transferred to <b><em>.local/share/found</em></b> This is to avoid overwriting changes you may have made yourself. However, you may wish to copy them manually. If so, check you don't inadvertently create duplicates.

    <b>V 2.0</b><br>
    At this time a major revision was done to ensure all default instruments had internal names that matched the filenames. This had been causing a lot of confusion. Also, where possible the instrument 'type' field was corrected on many of these, or added if it was missing. There are still some undefined as it was impossible to guess the intention of the designer.<br><br>
